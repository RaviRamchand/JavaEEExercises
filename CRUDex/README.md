# CrudEX

CrudEx is a Java Enterprise application that uses Thymeleaf, Spring Web, Lombok, H2 and Spring Data JDBC repos. 

This application allows users to create appointments, which will be added to the Appointment table in the h2 database, edit appointments, which will be updated in the Appointment table in the h2 database, and finally delete appointments, which will be deleted in the Appointment table in the h2 database.
